### BEFORE FLYING:

***First, I'm sorry for my English, as it is not my native language. You are Welcome to help me on my English Skill, and, obviously, with my Coding Skill (it is, also, not my native language) ;)***

__All the Settings are in the Settings File.__

__The Command's are on the Joystick and Throttle Chart : [S]ShortPress, [L]LongPress, [EL]ExtraLongPress, [S3]Modifier Key on Joystick__

**This Script require you have Check this Files before you start to Fly, so, please, take some minutes to check them.**

The Script work with a lot of States value. Some of them are very important:

 * **Landing Gear Switch** (Throttle EAC Switch) state is **Switch Down : Retracted / Switch Up : Deployed**
 
 * **Cargo Scoop Switch** (Throttle RDR ALTM Switch) state is **Switch Down : Retracted / Switch Up : Deployed**

 * **Harpoints** (Joystick MASTER Mode Control Button Longpress) is a press Button, so no switch state. You need to know, **it start retracted when you launch the Script**
 
When you launch the Game, the script start with this states (according the switch position for LGears and CScoop). 
If, for example, hardpoints is already deployed you should "tell" to the script it is without sending Command Key ; Press [S3] and Joystick MASTER Mode Control Button Longpress, to "align" the Harpoints state betwen game and script.
That goes for LGears and CScoop to. You can Switch the states without sending game commands, like previously, Press [S3] and switch LGears or/and CScoop if "mis aligned" 

The Optimal PIP Mode, make Backup of Previous engaged PIP. By Default it will return to //2 SYS 2 ENG 2 WEP (0) if you don't make change before deploying Hardpoints or Fire after the game launch. 
I suggest, when you launch the game, to make one change to PIP before deploying hardpoints and another before fire, so the script can backup those value.

Because of all this tracking states in the script, __HCS User should use L.Gears, C.Scoop, Hardpoints, and PIP on HOTAS__. Other commands should be OK to use via HCS

Almost ALL Optional Extra (OptimalPIPMode, Stop Fire Retract Hardpoints, Silent Runing OFF on Fire, SuperCruise on Throttle, ....) Can be switched ON/OFF on the Fly, Check Joystick and Throttle Chart's.
